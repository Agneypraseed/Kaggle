:  Why was the name TRINITY given to first detonation of a nuclear weapon?\nDocument 1 Cosine_Similarity_Score 0.568:\n\nThe origin of the code name Trinity for the test site is also\ninteresting, but the true source is unknown. One popular account\nattributes the name to J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific head of the\nManhattan Project. According to this version, the well read Oppenheimer\nbased the name Trinity on the fourteenth Holy Sonnet by John Donne, a\n16th century English poet and sermon writer. The sonnet started, \"Batter\nmy heart, three-personed God.\"[2] Another version of the name's origin\ncomes from University of New Mexico historian Ferenc M. Szasz. In his\n1984 book, The Day the Sun Rose Twice, Szasz quotes Robert W. Henderson\nhead of the Engineering Group in the Explosives Division of the\nManhattan Project. Henderson told Szasz that the name Trinity came from\nMajor W. A. (Lex) Stevens. According to Henderson, he and Stevens were\nat the test site discussing the best way to haul Jumbo (see below) the\nthirty miles from the closest railway siding to the test site. \"A devout\nRoman Catholic, Stevens observed that the railroad siding was called\n'Pope's Siding.' He [then] remarked that the Pope had special access to\nthe Trinity, and that the scientists would need all the help they could\nget to move the 214 ton Jumbo to its proper spot.\"[3]\n\n\nDocument 2 Cosine_Similarity_Score 0.558:\n\nThe true story of the Trinity test first became known to the public on\nAugust 6, 1945. This is when the world's second nuclear bomb, nicknamed\nLittle Boy, exploded 1,850 feet over Hiroshima, Japan, destroying a\nlarge portion of the city and killing an estimated 70,000 to 130,000\nof its inhabitants. Three days later on August 9, a third atomic bomb\ndevastated the city of Nagasaki and killed approximately 45,000 more\nJapanese. The Nagasaki weapon was a plutonium bomb, similar to the\nTrinity device, and it was nicknamed Fat Man. On Tuesday August 14, at 7\np.m. Eastern War Time, President Truman made a brief formal announcement\nthat Japan had finally surrendered and World War II was over after\nalmost six years and 60 million deaths!\n\n\nDocument 3 Cosine_Similarity_Score 0.557:\n\nThe Trinity test was originally set for July 4, 1945. However, final\npreparations for the test, which included the assembly of the bomb's\nplutonium core, did not begin in earnest until Thursday, July 12. The\nabandoned George McDonald ranch house located two miles south of the\ntest site served as the assembly point for the device's core. After\nassembly, the plutonium core was transported to Trinity Site to be\ninserted into the thing or gadget as the atomic device was called. But,\non the first attempt to insert the core it stuck! After letting the\ntemperatures of the core and the gadget equalize, the core fit perfectly\nto the great relief of all present. The completed device was raised\nto the top of a 100-foot steel tower on Saturday, July 14. During this\nprocess workers piled up mattresses beneath the gadget to cushion\na possible fall. When the bomb reached the top of the tower without\nmishap, installation of the explosive detonators began. The 100-foot\ntower (a surplus Forest Service fire-watch tower) was designated Point\nZero.

In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \"superior.\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals.
