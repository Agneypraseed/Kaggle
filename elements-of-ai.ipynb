The forecast said it's going to rain with 90% probability, which means it would not rain with 10% probability or in one out of 10 days. It is perfectly plausible that the day in question was the 1 in 10 event. Concluding that the probability 90% was correct would also be wrong because by the same argument, we could then conclude that 80% chance of rain was also correct, and both cannot be correct at the same time.\n\n\n**Odds**\n\nAn expression like 3:1 (three to one), which means that we expect that for every three cases of an outcome\n\nThe odds 1:5 (one win for every five losses), even if it can be expressed as the decimal number 0.2, is different from 20% probability (or probability 0.2 using the mathematicians’ notation).
