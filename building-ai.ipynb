Instead of only allowing changes that improve the solution (go uphill), some changes that make it worse (go downhill) are also allowed with some probability. \n\nThe probability of allowing a downwards transition depends on two things: how much downwards it goes and a so called 'temperature.' The higher the temperature, the higher the probability of allowing a downhill move.\n\nThe idea is to start at a high temperature so that the changes are more or less random, but to gradually decrease the temperature so that eventually, the probability of going downwards becomes vanishingly small.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
